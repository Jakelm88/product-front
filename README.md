# InterroFront

There is 2 data types on which the project is based : **products** (a generic name as a placeholder) and **users** (meaning there is an auth part to the project).

The home page shows a list of products. You can then **add** a new product or click on a product "DÃ©tail" link to view the details of it.
On the detail page of a product, you can **modify** or **delete** it.

The back server url is set at `http://localhost:3000/`
